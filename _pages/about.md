I'm an undergraduate student in Yingcai Honors College (top 2% students), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (supervied by Pro. [Kai Zheng](https://zheng-kai.com/)), which is a Class A [Double First Class University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_First_Class_University_Plan) and was included as one of the nation's first universities into ["Project 211"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_211) and [“Project 985”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_985). 

I conducted research on machine learning cosmology in McGill University (supervised by Pro. [Adrian Liu](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~acliu/), funded Chinese Scholarship Council and Mitacs) during 2019 Jun ~ 2019 Oct.

My current research focuses on developing cost-efficient methods of machine learning and data mining algorithms. Revolving around this goal, I mainly study the following topics: Spatio-temporal Data Mining, Fairness-aware Machine Learning, Recommendation System.
