I'm an undergraduate student in Yingcai Honors College (top 2% students), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), which is a Class A [Double First Class University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_First_Class_University_Plan) and was included as one of the nation's first universities into ["Project 211"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_211) and [“Project 985”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_985).
I visited McGill University, Canada funded by CSC (2019 Jun ~ 2019 Oct).

My current research focuses on developing cost-efficient methods of machine learning and data mining algorithms. Revolving around this goal, I mainly study the following topics: Recommendation systems, fairness-aware machine learning, Spatio-temporal and social network data mining.
